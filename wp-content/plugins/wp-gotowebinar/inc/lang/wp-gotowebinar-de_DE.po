"To connect your website to your GoToWebiner account we provide 2 ways to "

"it is subject to API rate limits. To have a more consistent connection we "
"recommend creating an application in GoToWebinar - it does take more effort "

"goto-developer.logmeininc.com/</a> and click \"My Apps\" and sign in with "
